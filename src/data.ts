{'title': 'Sidewalk', 'actors': 'Verane Pick', 'director': 'Barry Alexander Brown', 'synopsis': 'SIDEWALK chronicles the lives of primarily black homeless book vendors and magazine scavengers who ply their trade along 6th Avenue between 8th Street and Washington Place in New York City. By briefly comparing those book vendors with the history of book vending along the Seine in Paris, the film speaks to the efforts of North American and European societies to rid public space of the outcasts they have had a hand in producing. The film takes us into the social world of the people subsisting on the streets of New York by focusing on their work as street side booksellers, magazine vendors, junk dealers, panhandlers, and table watchers. The sidewalk becomes a site for the unfolding of these people living on the edge of society in order to give us a deeper understanding of how these individual\'s are able to survive. It also becomes a site for conflicts and solidarities that encompass the vendors and local residents. We followed half dozen vendors for most of this past decade. By the end of shooting the film, their lives had taken a myriad of routes - one was hired by a local University to run a speakers series, another left to find herself working at a 7\/11 convenience store, a third was deported to Jamaica where he struggles to survive without family, friends or a livelihood. Most of our characters have remained on the street continuing the daily struggle to scratch out a living on what the rest of us throw away. In this context, our main objective is to show HOW the sidewalk life works today. How do these people on the street live in a moral (and sometimes immoral) order? How do they have the ingenuity to do so in the face of exclusion and stigmatization on the basis of race and class? How does the way they do so affront the sensibilities of the working and middle classes? How do their acts intersect with a city\'s mechanisms to regulate its public spaces?', 'genres': 'Documentary', 'year': 2010, 'imdbId': 'tt1553312'},

The BAU has to figure out if it is a random attack, a targeted attack, a terrorist attack - homegrown or foreign - or even something related to the upcoming fiftieth anniversary of the shooting death of John F. Kennedy. The six unrelated victims were killed in different parts of the plaza, the remaining six bullets splattered elsewhere throughout the plaza, leading to the team initially believing that it was a random attack by someone who was a bad shooter. But the nature of the six killed leads them ultimately to believe that the sniper was indeed an excellent shot, with the six non-fatal bullets being red herrings. They have to look at the backgrounds of the six dead to see who was the intended target or targets. Reid is able to narrow the target list to three, and most likely no more than two, the remaining victims being collateral damage. When a second sniper shooting occurs at a gas station leaving three more dead, the theory that it was a targeted hit is strengthened based on the location of the shooter in relation to the station itself. They have to find a connection between whoever the target(s) in the first shooting to whoever the target(s) in the second shooting to at least find the unsub\'s motivation. Even if they are able to find the connection, discovering the identity of the actual sniper may be a little more difficult.', 'genres': 'Crime, Drama, Mystery', 'year': 2013, 'imdbId': 'tt3145880'},

His photographs are mainly displayed as backlit Cibachrome transparencies. In an interview with Sheena Wagstaff, Chief Curator at the Tate Modern, he said: Evaluation of quality is the core of the pleasure of the experience of art; the simultaneous pleasure of enjoying something intensely and of recognizing that it is a good work. I always judge my picture - daily, hourly, all the time. Even though it\'s disappointing to have to say \'that one is not good\', or \'not as good as that one\', it is still a pleasure to go through that process and experience a work afresh. Nothing has been as destructive to the condition of art as the idea that qualitative judgment is unimportant, and that art is important for cultural reasons. Art can only be important if it is good, because if it is good, it pleases us in ways we don\'t anticipate and don\'t understand, and that pleasure means something to us even if we can\'t specify what, exactly.', 'genres': 'Documentary', 'year': 2007, 'imdbId': 'tt1805273'},

After numerous arrests and the unwanted attention of the world, the government finally relents by recognizing rights for Indians, though not for the native blacks of South Africa. After this victory, Gandhi is invited back to India, where he is now considered something of a national hero. He is urged to take up the fight for India\'s independence from the British Empire. Gandhi agrees, and mounts a non-violent non-cooperation campaign of unprecedented scale, coordinating millions of Indians nationwide. There are some setbacks, such as violence against the protesters and Gandhi\'s occasional imprisonment. Nevertheless, the campaign generates great attention, and Britain faces intense public pressure. Too weak from World War II to continue enforcing its will in India, Britain finally grants India\'s independence. Indians celebrate this victory, but their troubles are far from over. Religious tensions between Hindus and Muslims erupt into nation-wide violence. Gandhi declares a hunger strike, saying he will not eat until the fighting stops. The fighting does stop eventually, but the country is divided. It is decided that the northwest area of India, and eastern part of India (current day Bangladesh), both places where Muslims are in the majority, will become a new country called Pakistan (West and East Pakistan respectively). It is hoped that by encouraging the Muslims to live in a separate country, violence will abate. Gandhi is opposed to the idea, and is even willing to allow Muhammad Ali Jinnah to become the first prime minister of India, but the Partition of India is carried out nevertheless. Gandhi spends his last days trying to bring about peace between both nations.

From his emergence as the princely pastor of Harlem\'s enormous Abyssinian Baptist Church, to his improbable, riotous political climb and eventual ruin, this must-watch film captures a man who was truly larger than life. Narrated by civil rights activist Julian Bond and resplendent with rich archival footage and candid interviews with those who knew him best, this tell-all documentary mines the good, bad, and ugly acts of Powell\'s illustrious but controversial career - the multiple marriages, the uproarious taunting of the white establishment, his desegregation of Congress, and his shameful smearing of Martin Luther King, Jr. from self-imposed exile on the island of Bimini. An unforgettable story of being unforgivably black in white America, ADAM CLAYTON POWELL makes for \'endlessly fascinating, thoroughly enjoyable\' viewing (Chicago Sun-Times). Masterfully directed by Richard Kilberg, this film explores the nature of power, personality, and politics as exemplified in a flawed, but sublime hero.', 'genres': 'Documentary', 'year': 1989, 'imdbId': 'tt0096761'},

Whether he is untangling the famously baffling films of David Lynch, or overturning everything you thought you knew about Hitchcock, Zizek illuminates the screen with his passion, intellect, and unfailing sense of humour. THE PERVERT\'S GUIDE TO CINEMA cuts its cloth from the very world of the movies it discusses; by shooting at original locations and from replica sets it creates the uncanny illusion that Zizek is speaking from \'within\' the films themselves. Together the three parts construct a compelling dialectic of ideas. Described by The Times in London as \'the woman helming this Freudian inquest,\' director Sophie Fiennes\' collaboration with Slavoj Zizek illustrates the immediacy with which film and television can communicate complex ideas. Says Zizek: \'My big obsession is to make things clear. I can really explain a line of thought if I can somehow illustrate it in a scene from a film. THE PERVERT\'S GUIDE TO CINEMA is really about what psychoanalysis can tell us about cinema.\'', 'genres': 'Documentary', 'year': 2006, 'imdbId': 'tt0828154'}
